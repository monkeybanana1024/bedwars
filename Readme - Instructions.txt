Hello! First of all thank you for downloading my setup! I hope you like :D

This setup is developed with all my love I have for the Minecraft community. 
In addition, it is the basis for my future premium setup. If you want to know what introduces the premium setup, on our discord are the sneak peaks.

You are downloading a stable version, that is, there are hardly any errors, and therefore, you can use it wherever you want! 
We do not recommend free hostings at all, since they do not work with SlimeWorldManager

I would be very grateful if you would join my Discord server and report ALL the bugs you find. (https://discord.gg/8ePy5n2Cht)

Now let's detail the steps for the setup to work correctly like me!

STEP 1: DOWNLOAD THIS TWO PLUGINS.
SEMI-PREMIUM PLUGINS:
This setup contains two semi-premium plugins. Here are the links for you to download the plugins!

https://builtbybit.com/resources/tab.20631/ & https://ci.citizensnpcs.co/job/Citizens2/ 

STEP 2: CREATE A START.BAT

START.BAT -> The setup uses SlimeWorldManager and Java 17! [IMPORTANT]

This is an example about start.bat: "java -javaagent:slimeworldmanager-classmodifier-2.2.1.jar -jar -Xmx2048m -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 spigot.jar"

The "-javaagent:slimeworldmanager-classmodifier-2.2.1.jar" always before the -jar! And uses the encoding=UTF-8!!

STEP 3: DOWNLOAD THE SPIGOT 1.12.2 (It has been removed from the setup to save space and upload it to the website)

STEP 4: UPDATE THE SETUP. 

There is some probability that you are already using this setup, therefore, in order not to replace all the files you have and their configurations, 
I have decided to upload the new files in another folder.

Therefore, open the UPDATE folder and drag all its contents to the server folder.

STEP 5: Start server and enjoy.. :D


IMPORTANT TO READ... 

About Friends and Party system... :D 
These types of setups are usually for networks, so here is the plugin you need to install and configure! 
I'm very sorry if there is not already one configured, I did not find any free plugin and that is not 
bungeecord to at least put it ... All free are for bungeecord (network) 

But bedwars plugin include only the party system.
